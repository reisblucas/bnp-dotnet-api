## Refactor challenge

This directory has a class called Calculator. It does not have an explicit business rule, don't worry about it.

You need to refactor it using clean code best practice criteria. The class should be clear, objective, easy to read and maintain.

### Objectives:

- **Calc() method is too dense**: Make it easier to read.
- **Remove any ambiguities**: Methods and variables need to be clear an descritives.
- **Design Pattern**: You can use Extraction, Inversion (when needed) and circuit breaker pattern.
- **Get lowest level of identations as possible**: Try to make Calc() function as flat as possible.

### Unit Tests:
The test `RefactorCalculatorTests` on file `refactor.calculator.test.cs`. You can always run it to check if the function keeps returning the expected result
